# FiedLinguisticsProject

I am attending a field linguistics class, and we ran into this issue of different people transcribing 
the same sound into different IPA transcriptions. I wondered if we can come up with a simple way to look
for a closest match in IPA alphabet automatically. I thought OpenSmile is a good starting point - and thus, 
this project began.
